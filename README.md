# Class Imbalance Effect on Intrusion Detection System
### $justify < With the growth of internet information, network security is becoming an immense challenge day by day. To face this challenge, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is the most important and very useful which suffer from various types of false alarms and intruders. Many machine learning and data mining algorithms are developed to detect these intruders. This paper focuses on the performance of the system to detect intruders efficiently. To do so, several algorithms and techniques are used, but most of these can’t due to some limitations of the dataset. To get high detection rate, Decision table (DT) is selected according to the performance which performs better in this field. By using DT, calculate the output for original dataset. Besides, reduce some irrelevant features by several methods from original dataset and analyze the performance for this reduced dataset. But in these cases, the classifier can’t provide best performance due to the dataset is imbalanced. To get best performance, this imbalance problem has to overcome. To do so, oversampling and under-sampling are used and finally get acceptable result.
