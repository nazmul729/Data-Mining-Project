# Class Imbalance Effect on Intrusion Detection System
With the growth of internet information, network security is becoming an immense challenge nowadays. To handle this challenge, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is the most important system which suffers from various types of false alarms and intruders. Machine learning and data mining algorithms have been developed to detect these intruders. This work focuses on the performance of the system to detect intruders efficiently. To do so, several algorithms and techniques are used, but most of these canâ€™t pperform properly due to some limitations in the dataset which is class imbalance. To get best performance, this imbalance problem has to overcome. We applied oversampling and under-sampling method and finally got acceptable result.
